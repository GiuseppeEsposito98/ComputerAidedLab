# LABORATORY 1 - Single server queuing system simulation.

## REQUIREMENTS:
To run the program please check that the files client.py, event.py and lab1.py are in the same folder. 
Moreover check that you have installed the package numpy in the current environment where you run the simulation beacuse it is used to run some random functions. 

## FOLDER CONTENT:
The file client.py contains the class Client i.e. the class for the arriving and departuring customers. 

The file event.py contains the class for the scheduled event where we keep track also of the relative client. 

The file lab1.py is the one containing the functions arrival() and departure(), the parameter of the simulation and the main loop. 

## INSTRUCTION TO START:
To start the simulation with the default parameters (SIM_TIME = 30, mu = 3, lam = 4) just run the lab1.py file.
