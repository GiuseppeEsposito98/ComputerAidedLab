# LABORATORY 09 - Single server queuing system - transient analysis .

## REQUIREMENTS:
To run the script check that you have installed the packages scipy, numpy and matplotlib in the current environment 
where you run the simulation beacuse they are used to compute confidence interva, run some random functions and to plot graphs respectively. 

## CONTENT FOLDER
This folder contains:
    -  the source code lab9.py that has to be run to start the simulation
    - graphs folder which is divided in 3 subfolders:
        • exponential: where the graph results computed with the exponential distribution are stored
        • hyper-exponential: where the graph results computed with the hyper-exponential distribution are stored
        • deterministic_process: where the graph results computed in the deterministic case are stored
    - A brief report which gives an overview of the problem and describes the main algorithm used

## INSTRUCTION TO START THE SIMULATION:
To start the simulation with the default parameters just run the lab9.py file. The input parameters are printed 
for each case study and also the result of the batch means algorithm is printed for each value odf utilization and 
for each distribution type.
