# FOLDER CONTENTS
This folder contains a python script called Routines.py where all the function used in the simulation are defines and lab06.py which you have to use to generate random variables from 5 different distributions:
    - Binomial
    - Normal
    - Chi-squared
    - Poisson
    - Rice

For the Binomial generation different approaches are presented:
    - Binomial:
        • Convolution
        • Inverse-transform
        • Method3


# RUN INSTRUCTIONS
To run the script you need to have installed the following libraries:
    - numpy
    - sci-py
