# OVERVIEW
Given a class of m students, we want to evaluate:
- the average number of people to observe a conflict and compare it with the teoretical formula. 


# FOLDER CONTENTS
- lab08.py: A main script that runs the simulation
- simulation.py: a processing script where all the function nedded for the experiment are defines. 
- graphs: a folder where all the plots will be stored after runningthe script. 
- births_distribution: a folder containing the required data to compute the real distribution of birthdays and 
    where another csv file will be stored whose content is the list of birthdays probabilities

# INSTRUCTION TO RUN
To run the file you have to install the numpy and matplotlib packages and then run the script lab07.py 
keeping it in the same folder of the folder "births distribution" and of simulation.py

# EXTENSION
Generalized case of the birthday paradox.
